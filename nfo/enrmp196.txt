[EN] Jenifer Ávila are a Spanish indie pop duo from Spain. Demo #1 was their debut release containing 8 tracks of what we once refered to as laidback spring afternoon tracks to lift your soul away. After 13 years of our continuous support and free promotion work for their project, on late March 2022, Fernando of Jenifer Ávila, replying to a news update sent to all our artists over an unrelated subject, requested that we remove this release from our catalogue. We politely informed him this was in breach of the terms of release agreement we had mutually agreed upon and against the very nature of the creative commons by-nc-sa license they had selected of their own free will 13 years ago to be used for this release. We are a label, not a temporary promo site, and the license selected by Jenifer Ávila gives anyone on the internet the right to copy and distribute this album, therefor we once again politely refused to destroy the 13 years of our work relationship on a whim that would break our listeners trust in our catalogue being permanent and open a dangerous precedent. We were threatened with legal action and told complete removal is the only way for them to be able to monetize the project. We suggested multiple alternatives to help them monetize their work (with or without Enough Records involvement), we also offered to rally a funding campaign for any specific monetary issue they could be going through, as we have done in the past for other Enough Records artists. In response we were pleaded to be human, demanded complete removal and threatened with legal action yet again. Regardless of legal threats, or the hypocrisy and disrespect towards our work that transpires from this request, Enough Records does honor any artist requests to not be present on any specific platforms as part of our release agreement, therefor, and to stop wasting any more of our time dealing with people who can't seem to be able to channel their new found regret and pandemic paranoia in a positive way forward, we have requested the removal of this album from most of the platforms we had been using to promote Jenifer Ávila for the past 13 years. We also removed any download links from our website. We will no longer support or promote their work in the future. Apologies to our listeners and followers for this situation, we hope to be able to restore the availability of the release sometime soon.
