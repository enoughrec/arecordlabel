They met in November 2007 when Victor came to Barnaul with a presentation of his book "A Glass Man and the Green Record". At that time they decided to try to do 2 or 3 tracks to see what would come out. By June 2009 the four tracks EP is done. They continue to work on a long playing album that will include Victor's poems and prose.
