soundZcapa - Merge of Two Unlike Sleeps [enrmp079]

[EN] You might have heard of <a href="mailto:zsszekelyhidi@greenlight.hu">soundZcapa</a> by his releases netlabels farfromshowbiz, bennekea and feketepont. His debut on enough is a smooth, sleepy and mostly calm 5 track ep called "merge of two unlike sleeps". Trying to represent the potential metaphysical contact between dreams of two people sleepin' in the same bed. The tracks made by improvisations on keyboard and drummachines on a lazy summer-end week.

[PT] EP de ambiental calminho, representando o contacto potencialmente metafísico entre os sonhos de duas pessoas a dormir na mesma cama, pelas mãos do projecto Hungaro <a href="mailto:zsszekelyhidi@greenlight.hu">soundZcapa</a>.
