ps - Go **** Yourself [enrmp455]

[EN] Short harsh noise EP by our founder member <a href="http://tpolm.org/~ps">ps</a>. This album is made from accumulated disappointment in humanity. "Lixívia pró Caruncho" translates into "bleach for removing wormwood", which according to the wisdom of the older Portuguese generation, it's the easiest way to clean your walls and ceilings of all that accumulated rot that has been festering in it. Good riddance to toxic people from my life. Both the cover and audio of this album were mangled together using regurgitated samples from releases of people that betrayed my trust.

[PT] EP de barulho violento pelas mãos do nosso membro fundador <a href="http://tpolm.org/~ps">ps</a>. Este album é composto de muita desilusão acumulada na humanidade. Ambos a capa e o audio foram criados remisturando violentamente até não serem reconhecivéis diversos excertos de edições criadas por pessoas que trairam a minha confiança.
