kdes vs ps - live helsinki 27 oct 2008 [enrmp200]

[EN] To celebrate our 200th non compilation release we bring you this special bootleg recorded by Sir Garbage Truck, of an experimental hardcore ambient jam session form our staff member <a href="https://tpolm.org/~ps">ps</a> and our Serbian friends from <a href="https://kosmoplovci.net">kosmoplovci</a> under their moniker kdes. Big thanks to Nosfe who arranged for us to play in that art gallery (Oksasenkatu 11) somewhere in the middle of Helsinki. Sorry to the person whose sound system we managed to slightly destroy, and thanks to everyone who we met during that week, we have good memories.

[PT] Gravação de um concerto de improv hardcore experimental ambient tocado em Helsinkia entre <a href="https://tpolm.org/~ps">ps</a> e o colectivo Sérbio kdes / <a href="https://kosmoplovci.net">kosmoplovci</a>.
