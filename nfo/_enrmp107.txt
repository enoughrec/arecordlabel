Roberto Maldoror Manfredini - La Prima Sega di Mishima [enrmp107]

[EN] Contemporary experimental written by sound artist <a href="http://archeodada.altervista.org/">Roberto Maldoror Manfredini</a> contacted us trying to re-release under our netlabel some of his previously limited edition creations put out through a now defunct local label. This album was one of the first we listened to and imediatly adored, both for it's concept and the sounds derived from it, it's a love tribute to the great Yukio Mishima, even if the title it's kind of... satyrical (the translation could be "Mishima's first rat's fuck", based on the book "Confession of a mask", where he describes his first masturbation on the image of Saint Sebastian).

[PT] Re-edição de um album do Italiano <a href="http://archeodada.altervista.org/">Roberto Maldoror Manfredini</a>, previamente editado em edição limitada. Tributo spoken word ao trabalho de Yukio Mishima.
