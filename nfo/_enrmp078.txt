Extrapool - Everything is Cancer [enrmp078]

[EN] This release is the first release under the moniker <a href="http://myspace.com/extrapool">Extrapool</a> but <a href="mailto:jpspradley@hotmail.com">Phillip Spradley</a> has done other releases as "human" on ivdt years back. all his other releases thus far were handmade, extremely limited ones. the name extrapool, and the music made is sort of a reflection on everything that clogs human existance. things commonly associated to "living" that have nothing to do with "surviving". in one sense the work is completely conceptual and another it's satirical. the sound itself is not fixed and ranges from noise and found samples to glitch and breakcore (sort of). influences are mainly first wave industrial, back when the sound was raw and non-conforming (throbbing gristle, whitehouse, einsturzende neubatan, laibach), as well as current more rhythmatic idm artists (richard devine, xanopticon).

[PT] Edição de noise industrial pelas mãos do projecto <a href="http://myspace.com/extrapool">extrapool</a>, oriundo dos Estados Unidos.
