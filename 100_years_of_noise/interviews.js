This process of improvising with Fluxations and FluxNoisations is discussed in "Improvising Synesthesia" in Leonardo Electronic Almanac v.19/2, 2013.  Both systems (FluxNoisations and Fluxations) use an infrared camera and Sofia Paraskeva\'s wireless gloves as a full-body controller for music (sound) and graphic (visual) generative algorithms I developed and programmed in the RTcmix computer music language and Processing computer graphics environment. The generated sounds are based on physical models of real objects.';

Noise is often defined by negation:  sounds that are unintended or that one does not want to hear. Yet, as they say, "one man\'s signal is another man\'s noise." That extends beyond differences between individuals to differences within individuals. What may be noise to a person in one context, or one point in time, may be (or become) music to the same person in another context or time. We hope for a fluidity between noise and music such that neither term applies in any absolute way. For some of us, as least some of the time, we nevertheless call what we _want_ to hear "noise." And that\'s because of two things:  (1) We somehow expect that some others will _not_ consider these sounds _music_, and related to this (2) there\'s an expectation that what is called "music" will be somehow regular, conventional, or harmonious in some traditional sense.';

I manipulate these through controlled movements of my hands and body, a sort of dance.  The system also generates graphics in real-time, which are also manipulated by the same hand and body movement.

I took a real long time trying to figure out on what to do, and specially because my first idea, of improvising a solo guitar to complement this piano wasn\'t succeeded. Then, after a while, I decided to meditate on the recording itself, and experiment with its possibilities in electroacoustic terms. Also, I recorded improvisational experiments with a recently acquired footswitch pedals plugged with my guitar and amplifiers. And, so, the electroacoustic piece was made with a series of proccesses I put into those samples and, also, with waves of microtonal frequencies.

In a world where “popular music is pre-digested” (Adorno, 1941), a commodity of masses, an engine of the spectacle, noise music attempts to tear down what there is of ‘music’ in itself, as a vanguard, it is a counter-cultural attempt of eradicating what of art it may contain, which, paradoxically makes it take the step into the new unframed chaos.  The free utilization of noise, as in noise music, is the paradox-object of the spectacle, it is its thesis and anti-thesis. Noise\'s paradox functions analogue to John Cage’s 4’33’’ for it is an emphasizing of what is already there, it ceases to be silence to become the foreground of contemplation, an empowering of awareness.

The piece is a cycle in between the two sections of a trip from Above Air to Below Ground: on the first part, Above Air, there is a crescendo from the earth into an aerial state of trance and then down to the limbo between human and divine, with the sound of the Muslim call to the sacred rituals. The second part, Below Ground, begins with a crescendo that gets broken suddenly to give way to an immersive and chaotic mass of noise, an underworld that gets also broken into a cold silent tension of squeaking saxophones that resemble moribund creatures, and then a crescendo of frenzy builds up again as a runaway from death and is again suddenly killed with silence.';

The sense of stress and tension grows with noise additive. It allows the instruments to burst free of audience expectations and accepted norms.

After the piece was worked out in detail as a duet, the other two members of this band--guitarist Javier Hernandez-Miyares and clarinetist Quincy Saul--create parts which both mimicked the rhythmic patterns and worked against them to add tension. Quincy\'s clarinet part included a klezmer-like  quality which added some warmth to the whole while Javier\'s effect created a wall of sonic concrete about us. Each time we performed this piece, it shifted and varied, growing in length and breadth until it came to a natural conclusion.
