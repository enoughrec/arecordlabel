"Kaleidoscope" is an improvisational work based on a modal D scale and an intensive rhythmic pattern established by Pietaro's xylophone, arranged by Towers dominant, driving bass, and completed by Saul's rather Klezmer-inspired clarinet motives and the guitar soundscape of Hernandez-Miyares. The piece builds steadily but with brief points of relief, and with each crescendo the sonic force rises and rhythmic burn attempts to push the riffs beyond any imaginable bar-line. Upbeats and downbeats morph into each other, dancing about; the wider sound smears, blurs, washes over itself. These combined occurrences  approximate additive rhythms as the pulse charges. The title "Kaleidoscope" was inspired by the interlocking and ever-changing patterns but upon further reflection, one can see that the populace of instruments stepping all over itself---agitated, loud, frantic, futile, noisey, and with blind determinism---a political meaning is also easily drawn....perhaps I should have added a fiddle and some backward slogans and named this ditty "The Conservative Hoe-Down".
