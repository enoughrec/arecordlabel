For me noise is a catharsis. A hidden place where i can go and bleed out the frustrations from everyday life. Both listening and composing noise music are some sort of shamanic out-of-body experience to me. The sensorial overload and unpredictable nature of noise numbs me, almost like a drug, to the extreme where i feel sheltered from other external stimulus and can focus on the purge or enter "the zone" of fast rational thinking.

Besides being a starving media artist i freelance as a software developer. Listening to noise while programming helps clean out the distractions around you, not only as a sound wall that blocks everyone around you but most of all as a channeler of focus and negative energy. Like in an anime, you amass dark energy in your mouth and blast it all out at your enemy, in my case, the spaghetti code refactoring nightmare of the day.

This piece in particular is a rework from an unreleased remix i did for fellow noise artist EYE8SOCCER. EYE8SOCCER focuses on making noise pieces out of soccer matches reports. I adapted the unreleased remix to fit the current frustrating scenario of life in Portugal. The economic crisis perpetrated by lack of accountability on high ranking corrupt government officials and the sense of apathy and helplessness from our people to fix what is clearly wrong in the political and judicial system.
