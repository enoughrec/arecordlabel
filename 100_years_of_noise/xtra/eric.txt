As a drummer, it is refreshing to work on music "outside of time", where locking to a metronome tempo isn't necessary. I also enjoy the idea that all sound is music, that we are part of the music by default, by living, by being. Noise offers depth and texture where other genres cannot, and the music is music within itself to be comprehendible on many listening levels. The idea that there is an orchestral world of sound within a simple voicing. It is up to the listener as to what he or she derives from the piece. Noise is interpretable on a personal level. Like all musics, it too carries healing properties for the mind and soul. Thank You, Eric the Taylor, Rochester NY
