Smelt is a mixture of dialogue written and practiced, improvised stream of consciousnesses, spoken dairy remembered loops in the brain, sound wise including subliminal brain training tapes hidden in the mix, keyboard stabs of disdain, and almost moving in to a groove at time, a dystopian nightmare blues.

Obviously the name itself refers to the multi faceted levels, Smelt is mean small or young fish, Smelt as in metals, Smelt as in smelling in the past tense, or more poetical Smelt, meaning be understood, as in I Smelt it coming, etc. 

The noise music connection is that it is hardly music, more soundart, an audio walk through a thought.

Originally made as part of a tape album called "Weird" back in 1992.
