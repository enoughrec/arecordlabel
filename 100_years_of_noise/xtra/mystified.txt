"Puzzle Sandwich 2" uses layers of sounds to create noise. One layer was crafted with a "bag of trash"-- a paper bag I once had filled with aluminum cans and newspaper. I liked to record manipulations of the bag with my hands. The other layer is the kind of noise created with radio static. Together, these 2 layers comprise the "sandwich".
